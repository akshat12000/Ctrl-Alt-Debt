## Problem Statement
-   Gyandaan is analogous to Shramdaan, which means voluntary contribution of knowledge. Gyandaan is made of two words, ‘Gyan’ means knowledge and ‘daan’ means donation. It means a voluntary contribution of citizens towards community education involving teaching, mentoring and helping someone in academics. It is a way of helping our society and contributing for the overall upliftment of the students especially from the underprivileged and poor backgrounds who can't afford to enroll themselves into coaching classes and other courses.
    
-   Design and develop a platform where students enroll to learn and obtain mentorship and volunteers enroll themselves to help / mentor those students.
    
-   Students mention what subjects / career goals they need help with or need mentorships. The topics can be anything from a specific topic like "trigonometry" to a broader subject like "Class 10th CBSE Math". Students can ask help for more than one topics with their preferences like time & day of the week.
    
-   Volunteers mention the areas of their expertise and their availability in a week. They can specify maximum hours they are willing to volunteer in a week.
    
-   The platform does the matching of students to volunteers and the sessions happen over electronic means like GMeet or Zoom or any similar online platform.
    
-   Use your creativity on how you make the platform engaging, safe and efficient (student to volunteer ratios).

## Solution
We have developed a website to help students gain knowledge, and increase their understanding on several topics, free of cost. Our website has the following features:

1.  **Mentorship Sessions:** Students can choose a suitable time slot of 30mins, to video call with a mentor who will explain their doubts. Timings are flexible, for students’ convenience. If students have any issues after the video call, they can report after the session ends.
    
2.  **Blogs:** Volunteers, who are experts in their chosen field can post blogs related to a particular topic, which will be beneficial for the students reading it.
    
3.  **Discussion Forum:** Students can also post their doubts in the discussion forum, which can be answered by other students as well as the volunteers, thus encouraging learning and curiousness in students’ minds.

4.  **Resources:** Students can get access to NCERT book PDFs of all the subjects of their respective classes. NCERT books provides a strong foundation and a deep understanding of different topics, thus benefiting the students hugely.
    
5.  **Student Leaderboard:** Students will be given points and ranks on the basis of their activity on our website. They will be given 5 points for daily check-in and 1 point for answering some students’ doubt in the discussion forum. This will ensure that students’ engage in a healthy competition, thus increasing their productivity.
    
6.  **Volunteers Leaderboard:**  Volunteers will also be given ranks on the basis of the number of sessions they conduct, as well as the number of blogs they write. This is our way to encourage and appreciate them, for their contribution.

7. **Page translation:** We understand that some students/volunteers might not be well versed with English. To make things more convenient for such users, our website can be viewed in English as well as Hindi.

## Future Scope
-   We will try to incorporate some more advanced methods such as AI/ML to improve the safety of our website such as comment filtering (as spam or inappropriate), more involved reporting feature,etc.
    
-   Due to time constraints we were only able to switch between the languages for the static content of our website but by using some more powerful tools we will do the same for the dynamic content as well.
    
-   We will try to introduce more and more user engaging activities for both volunteers as well as students, such as, quizzes, badges for achieving certain amount of points, etc.
